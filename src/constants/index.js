// export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate full stack developer with a knack for crafting robust and scalable web applications. With 5 years of hands-on experience, I have honed my skills in front-end technologies like React and Next.js, as well as back-end technologies like Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. My goal is to leverage my expertise to create innovative solutions that drive business growth and deliver exceptional user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I'm Mridha Imran Kabir — a backend-focused full-stack developer passionate about building powerful and scalable web applications.

Currently, I’m working at Barikoi Technologies Limited, where I’m diving deep into advanced backend technologies including Laravel Websockets, Redis, Nginx, AWS, and geospatial data handling with MySQL/PostgreSQL.

Previously, I made significant contributions at Phone Tech BD Ltd., completing end-to-end feature development across multiple Laravel-based projects using Livewire and MySQL. I’m also skilled in React, Vue 3, and Django REST for building robust personal and collaborative projects.

I love solving problems — whether it's through code or logic — and I actively hone my skills on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

I'm always eager to learn, grow, and take on meaningful challenges that create real-world impact.`;
